# NeatPlates
NeatPlates is a nameplate addon for BFA or later expansions.

Use the command, `'/NeatPlates'` or /np as a shortcut to the interface panel for NeatPlates. On that panel, you'll be able to select from a list of available themes. The theme you choose will affect both appearance and features.

Use the command, `'/hub'` to configure the mechanics of those included themes. If you're using a custom theme, it might have a different config tool.

## Credits
This addon is based on the [Tidy Plates project](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tidy-plates) and was created during a time where said project no longer worked with the current version of the game. As such I feel it is important to credit the original authors, [danltiger](https://wow.curseforge.com/members/danltiger) and [CynthiaV](https://wow.curseforge.com/members/CynthiaV), for all the work they put into the original addon.

## Future Features & Stuff

*Anything on the board is subject to change and doesn't neccessarily mean that it will become a feature.*

 
#
*If you are transitioning from 'Tidy Plates Continued' to 'NeatPlates' and wish to keep your settings. You can do this by loading both TPC and NeatPlates, at that point NeatPlates should show a prompt asking if you wish to import these settings.*
